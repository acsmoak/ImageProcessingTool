# ImageProcessingTool
This tool is a condensed version of the older image processing application.

The objective for this project was to write an image viewing, manipulation, and compositing tool. 
The application could be written using GLSL with C++ or with Python using an image library of our choice.
At a minimum, the following operations must be included: gamma correction, contrast, edge detection, 
sharpen, blur, median spatial filter, mix, key mix, over operator, luma keying, chroma keying, 
color difference method, and a write function to save the results. The distance, add, invert, and 
two multiply functions were included to complete the required operations more efficiently. 
I’ve additionally included the sobel operator, gaussian blur, and the screen operator. 
Finally, to make the tool user-friendly, I’ve included a menu prompt and a key handling function.
